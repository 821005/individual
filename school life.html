		<p>ROYAL COLLAGE - COLOMBO 07 - SRI LANKA. <br><br>In 1835, Rev. Joseph Marsh started a private school at the back verandah of the church called the Hill Street Academy for twenty students from the upper class community situated at Hill Street, Pettah.[19]
Then in the following year in 1835, Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, the British Governor of Ceylon, based on the recommendations of the Colebrooke Commission, established the Colombo Academy,[20] an English public school modeled on Eton College, with Marsh continuing as headmaster on government pay.[21] It was the oldest public school on the island and had the governor as its patron.[22] It gave the children of leading Ceylonese an education which would make them fit to be citizens of the British Empire and served as the principal public school and a model for other government schools that were to be built in Ceylon.[23] In 1836 the school was moved to San Sebastian Hill, Pettah, (prior to which it was at Maradana, next to Hulftsdorp); it would stay there for another 75 years before being shifted to Thurstan Road. Even though the college had close ties to Anglicanism in its early years, since 1836 it has remained a secular school. </p>
